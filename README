MeshTK is a C++ toolkit for mesh manipulations based on CGAL library. The 
functions provide by MeshTK should be (pre-)processing, features 
extraction, curvature estimation and a lot.

It is still UNDER CODING, and expected to be a software(rather than a 
library), with command line interface and binary/ascii IO.
