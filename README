1 Introduction 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mesh Toolkit(MeshTK) is a C++ toolkit developed for general proposed research in fields of 3D meshes. The package contains
 - libmeshtk.so (pre-build binary file and source code), built with CGAL and OpenGL. It is a dynamic library to process and visualize triangle meshes(either watertight or not). It is expected to have some features like normal and curvature estimation, remesh and smoothing, etc.
 - MeshTK (pre-build software under Linux & GNU G++ and source code), a demo and useful program to use the library. 

*IMPORTANT*: It is still UNDER CODING, thus no release is available NOW.
