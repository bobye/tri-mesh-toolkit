You need to install several libraries before to compile the library 
libmeshtk.so and command-line program called MeshTK.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please follow the instructions provided by the offical sites to 
install following libraries. OpenGL and CGAL are compulsory to link
by building libraries, and TCLAP is only used for MeshTK.
 
* OpenGL
 http://www.opengl.org/
 http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

* CGAL
 http://www.cgal.org/

* PETSc
 http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/

* TCLAP
 http://tclap.sourceforge.net/
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit *Makefile* in root directory properly, to make sure the 
compile option is correct, and type

 make all

to build library and compile the command-line software, this will 
generate a binary excutable one in the current directly:

 MeshTK

excutable examples in directory

 example/

and dynamic library and header files in directory

 include/
 lib/

If you are just interested in compiling libmeshtk.so and would like 
to write program with support of libmeshtk, you may compile the 
library only by typing

 make libmeshtk


If you want to recompile the project, make sure you get cleaned

 make cleanall
