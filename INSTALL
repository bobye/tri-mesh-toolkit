You need to install several libraries before to compile the library 
libmeshtk.so and command-line program called MeshTK.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please follow the instructions provided by the offical sites to 
install following libraries. OpenGL and CGAL are compulsory to link
by building libraries, and TCLAP is only used for MeshTK.
 
* OpenGL
 http://www.opengl.org/
 http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

* CGAL
 http://www.cgal.org/

* TCLAP
 http://tclap.sourceforge.net/
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit *Makefile* in root directory properly, to make sure the 
compile option is correct, and type

 make all

to build library and compile the command-line software, this will 
generate a binary excutable one in the current directly:

 MeshTK

and dynamic library and header files in directory

 include/
 lib/

If you are just interested in compiling libmeshtk.so and would like 
to write program with support of libmeshtk, you may compile the 
library only by typing

 make lib
